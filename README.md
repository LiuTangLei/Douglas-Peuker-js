README
This project provides a JavaScript implementation of the Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm. It has been tested over a long period of time and has proven to be reliable.

Usage
The code can be used by simply copying the files into your project without the need for any additional npm dependencies. You can modify the code to suit your needs as necessary.

Algorithm Description
The Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm is an algorithm used to simplify lines in a way that preserves their shape. It does this by recursively removing points from the line until a specified tolerance is reached. The result is a simplified line that approximates the original line.
